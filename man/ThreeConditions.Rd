\details{
BT549 cell trajectories were computed using cellmigRation.  
Imaging experiments were performed as described by Ghannoum S 
et al (paper in preparation). Briefly, triple negative breast 
cancer BT549 cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS 
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transduced with 
NucLight green lentivirus (Essen BioScience), and then sorted by  
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). GFP-positive cells 
were seeded at a 1:3 ratio with untransduced BT549 cells in 
96-well image-lock plates (EssenBio) at a density of 1000 
total cells per well.
Cells were scanned at ten-minute intervals over 24h using an 
Incucyte S3 Live-Cell microscope (EssenBio) at 10x magnification 
and a Basler Ace 1920-155um camera with CMOS sensor. 
Cells were treated with 100 uM Rac1 Inhibitor (1177865-17-6, 
Calbiochem) or left untreated (controls).  TIFF images 
were imported and processed using the cellmigRation library.
